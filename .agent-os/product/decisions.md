## 2025-08-14: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

DailyNutriFit will be a health-focused fruit delivery mobile app targeting health-conscious individuals, busy professionals, fitness enthusiasts, and people with dietary restrictions. The app will provide personalized fruit subscriptions based on health profiles, with flexible delivery scheduling and a convenient wallet-based payment system.

### Context

The market shows significant demand for convenient healthy eating solutions, with 90% of Americans not meeting daily fruit recommendations. Existing services are either too generic or overly complex, creating an opportunity for a health-first, personalized fruit delivery service that combines convenience with nutritional science.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **General Meal Kit Service**
   - Pros: Larger market, proven business model
   - Cons: Highly competitive, not health-focused, complex logistics

2. **Grocery Delivery Integration**
   - Pros: Existing infrastructure, wider product range
   - Cons: No personalization, lost in broader catalog, low margins

3. **Health-Focused Fruit Delivery** (Selected)
   - Pros: Focused market, high personalization, clear value proposition
   - Cons: Niche market, complex health algorithm requirements

### Rationale

Selected health-focused fruit delivery because it addresses a clear market gap with a differentiated approach. The combination of health personalization, convenience, and mobile-first experience creates strong competitive advantages and user loyalty potential.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear market positioning and differentiation
- Strong user retention potential through health outcomes
- Scalable technology foundation with React Native and Supabase
- Flexible subscription model accommodating various user needs

**Negative:**
- Smaller initial market compared to general food delivery
- Complex health algorithm development requirements
- Need for nutritional expertise and health professional partnerships
- Higher customer acquisition costs due to niche targeting

## 2025-08-14: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use React Native with Expo for mobile development and Supabase as the backend-as-a-service platform, with Stripe for payment processing and Expo services for app distribution.

### Context

Need a technology stack that enables rapid development, cross-platform deployment, and scalable backend infrastructure while maintaining development efficiency and minimizing operational complexity.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Native iOS/Android Development**
   - Pros: Best performance, platform-specific features
   - Cons: Separate codebases, slower development, higher costs

2. **Flutter + Firebase**
   - Pros: Single codebase, Google ecosystem integration
   - Cons: Dart language learning curve, less React ecosystem benefits

3. **React Native + Supabase** (Selected)
   - Pros: JavaScript ecosystem, rapid development, PostgreSQL database, built-in auth
   - Cons: Expo limitations, potential vendor lock-in

### Rationale

React Native with Supabase provides the optimal balance of development speed, cross-platform capability, and scalable infrastructure. The JavaScript ecosystem familiarity reduces development time, while Supabase's PostgreSQL foundation provides flexibility for complex health data relationships.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid cross-platform development capability
- Strong ecosystem support and community
- Built-in authentication and real-time features
- Scalable PostgreSQL database with advanced querying

**Negative:**
- Potential Expo limitations for advanced native features
- Supabase vendor dependency
- Learning curve for Supabase-specific patterns
