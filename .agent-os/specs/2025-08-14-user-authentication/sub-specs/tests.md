# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-14-user-authentication/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-14
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**AuthContext**
- Should initialize with null user state
- Should update user state when login succeeds
- Should clear user state when logout is called
- Should handle authentication errors gracefully
- Should persist user session across app restarts

**Registration/Login Forms**
- Should validate email format correctly
- Should validate password strength requirements
- Should display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs
- Should clear form errors when user corrects input
- Should disable submit button during API calls

**Profile Management**
- Should update user profile information successfully
- Should validate required fields before submission
- Should handle profile update errors with user feedback
- Should maintain form state during updates

### Integration Tests

**Authentication Flow**
- Should complete full registration flow with email verification
- Should authenticate existing users with correct credentials
- Should reject login attempts with incorrect credentials
- Should maintain authentication state across screen navigation
- Should handle password reset flow end-to-end

**Database Integration**
- Should create profile record automatically on user registration
- Should retrieve user profile data correctly
- Should update profile information in database
- Should handle multiple delivery addresses for single user
- Should respect Row Level Security policies

**Supabase Integration**
- Should initialize Supabase client correctly
- Should handle network connectivity issues gracefully
- Should refresh JWT tokens automatically
- Should sync authentication state with Supabase session

### Feature Tests

**End-to-End User Registration**
- User can open app, navigate to signup, complete registration form, verify email, and access app dashboard
- New user profile is created with basic information and ready for additional setup

**End-to-End User Login**
- Returning user can open app, enter credentials, authenticate successfully, and access their personalized dashboard

**Profile Management Workflow**
- Authenticated user can navigate to profile, update personal information, add/edit delivery addresses, and see changes reflected across the app

### Mocking Requirements

- **Supabase Auth Methods:** Mock signUp, signIn, signOut, and user session methods for isolated testing
- **Email Verification:** Mock email confirmation flow to test registration without actual email delivery
- **Database Queries:** Mock profile and address CRUD operations for unit tests
- **AsyncStorage:** Mock local storage operations for session persistence testing
- **Network Requests:** Mock API failures and slow responses to test error handling and loading states

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Testing Framework
- **Jest** for unit and integration testing
- **React Native Testing Library** for component testing
- **Detox** for end-to-end testing (optional, for comprehensive coverage)

### Test Data Management
- Use test user accounts in Supabase development environment
- Clean up test data after each test run
- Mock external dependencies to avoid side effects

### Coverage Targets
- **Unit Tests:** 90%+ coverage for authentication logic and forms
- **Integration Tests:** Cover all critical user paths and error scenarios
- **Feature Tests:** Verify complete user workflows work end-to-end
