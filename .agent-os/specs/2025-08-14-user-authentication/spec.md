> Created: 2025-08-14
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a secure user authentication system that enables users to register, login, and manage their profiles within the DailyNutriFit app. This foundational feature will support personalized fruit delivery preferences, health profiles, and wallet management for all subsequent app functionality.

## User Stories

### New User Registration

As a health-conscious individual, I want to create an account with my email and password, so that I can access personalized fruit delivery services.

**Workflow:** User opens the app, taps "Sign Up", enters email/password/basic profile info, receives email verification, verifies email, and gains access to the main app with their personal profile.

### Returning User Login

As an existing user, I want to securely log into my account using my credentials, so that I can access my personalized delivery schedules and health preferences.

**Workflow:** User opens app, enters email/password on login screen, gets authenticated, and lands on their personalized dashboard with their delivery history and preferences.

### Profile Management

As a registered user, I want to update my personal information and manage my account settings, so that I can keep my delivery preferences and contact information current.

**Workflow:** User accesses profile section, updates personal details (name, email, phone, delivery address), changes password if needed, and saves changes with confirmation of updates.

## Spec Scope

1. **Email/Password Registration** - New users can create accounts with email verification
2. **Secure Login/Logout** - Users can authenticate and securely end sessions
3. **Profile Management** - Users can view and update personal information and delivery preferences

- Advanced security features like device fingerprinting

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can successfully register new accounts with email verification
2. Users can log in and out securely with proper session handling
