> Spec: Fruit Catalog System

> Status: Planning
> Priority: P1 (High) - Core product functionality, needed for MVP

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive fruit catalog that displays available fruits with detailed information, high-quality images, nutritional data, and pricing. This catalog will serve as the foundation for the ordering system and enable users to browse and discover fruits that match their health needs.

## User Stories

### Browse Available Fruits

As a health-conscious user, I want to browse through all available fruits with clear images and descriptions, so that I can discover new fruits and make informed choices for my nutrition goals.

**Workflow:** User opens the app, navigates to the fruit catalog, scrolls through categorized fruits (seasonal, tropical, citrus, berries, etc.), taps on fruits to see detailed information, and can add them to favorites or cart.

### View Detailed Fruit Information

As a nutrition-focused user, I want to see detailed nutritional information, health benefits, and seasonal availability for each fruit, so that I can choose fruits that best support my health goals.

**Workflow:** User taps on a fruit from the catalog, views detailed screen with nutritional facts, health benefits, seasonal availability, storage tips, and customer reviews, then can add to cart or save to favorites.

### Search and Filter Fruits

As a user with specific dietary needs, I want to search for fruits by name or filter by categories (low sugar, high fiber, vitamin C rich), so that I can quickly find fruits that meet my specific requirements.

**Workflow:** User uses search bar to find specific fruits or applies filters (nutritional benefits, seasonal, price range, availability), views filtered results, and selects fruits that match their criteria.
