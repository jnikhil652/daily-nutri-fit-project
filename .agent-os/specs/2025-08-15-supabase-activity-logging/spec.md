# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Supabase Activity Console Logging System
> Created: 2025-08-15
> Status: Planning
> Priority: P2 (Medium) - Development debugging and monitoring enhancement

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive console-based logging system to track all Supabase database operations and API activities throughout the DailyNutriFit application. This system will provide detailed visibility into database interactions, API calls, and user activities for debugging, monitoring, and development purposes without persisting logs to the database.

## User Stories

### Developer Story
As a developer, I want to see detailed console logs of all Supabase operations, so that I can debug issues, monitor performance, and understand application behavior during development.

**Workflow:**
1. Developer opens browser console or terminal
2. Performs actions in the application (login, browse fruits, add to cart, checkout, etc.)
3. Views real-time console logs showing:
   - Database queries executed
   - API responses and errors
   - User authentication events
   - Payment processing activities
   - Data mutations and their results

### QA Tester Story
As a QA tester, I want to trace application activities through console logs, so that I can identify root causes of bugs and verify feature functionality.

**Workflow:**
1. QA tester reproduces a bug scenario
2. Reviews console logs to trace the sequence of operations
3. Identifies where the failure occurred in the data flow
4. Reports specific technical details to developers

## Spec Scope

1. **Authentication Logging** - Log all auth events (login, logout, signup, session management)
2. **Database Operation Logging** - Log all CRUD operations with table names, affected rows, and performance metrics
3. **API Request Logging** - Log all Supabase API calls with request/response data
4. **Error Logging** - Enhanced error tracking with context and stack traces
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Log query execution times and performance metrics
6. **User Activity Tracking** - Log user actions and their corresponding database operations

## Out of Scope

- Database persistence of logs
- Log aggregation or analytics
- Production logging infrastructure
- Log rotation or cleanup mechanisms
- External logging service integration

## Expected Deliverable

1. Console logging wrapper for all Supabase operations
2. Structured log format with timestamps, operation types, and detailed metadata
3. Performance metrics including query execution times
4. Error tracking with full context and stack traces
5. Integration with existing codebase with minimal changes to current functionality
6. Documentation for developers on how to use and interpret the logs
