## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 (High Priority)**
- Tasks 1.1-1.5: Core logger infrastructure
- Tasks 2.1-2.3: Basic client wrapper functionality
- Task 4.1: Integration with main supabase client

**Phase 2 (Medium Priority)**  
- Tasks 3.1-3.6: Complete operation logging
- Tasks 4.2-4.5: Configuration and environment setup
- Tasks 5.1-5.3: Core testing

**Phase 3 (Low Priority)**
- Tasks 5.4-5.5: Advanced testing and validation
- Tasks 6.1-6.5: Documentation and guides

## Dependencies

- TypeScript definitions for logging interfaces
- React Native console API compatibility
- Performance measurement APIs (performance.now())
- Environment variable access (__DEV__, process.env)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All Supabase operations generate detailed console logs
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible (< 5ms overhead per operation)
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly masked in logs
- [ ] Logging only activates in development environment
- [ ] Error logs include full context and stack traces
- [ ] Documentation allows easy adoption by development team
