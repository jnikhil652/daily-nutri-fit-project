> Status: Planning
> Priority: P3 (Low) - User engagement and growth features, implement after core platform

## Overview

Transform DailyNutriFit from an individual nutrition app into a social wellness platform that fosters community engagement, family connectivity, and peer motivation. This phase introduces social features that leverage the power of community to enhance user retention, expand the user base through referrals, and create lasting healthy habits through shared experiences and friendly competition.

## User Stories

### Family Plans and Multi-User Management

As a family health manager, I want to create shared subscriptions with individual health profiles for each family member, so that I can manage everyone's nutrition needs from one account while respecting their individual dietary requirements and preferences.

**Detailed Workflow:** Family administrators create master accounts that can add family members with their own health profiles, goals, and preferences. Each member maintains their individual nutritional tracking and recommendations while sharing billing and delivery coordination. The system provides family-wide analytics and helps coordinate deliveries for optimal household management.

### Referral System and Social Growth

As a satisfied user, I want to invite friends to try DailyNutriFit and earn rewards for successful referrals, so that I can share my positive health journey while receiving benefits for helping others improve their nutrition.

**Detailed Workflow:** Users generate personalized referral codes/links that they can share through various channels. When friends sign up and complete their first delivery, both users receive rewards (credits, special fruits, or plan upgrades). The system tracks referral success rates, provides sharing tools, and celebrates successful connections.

### Community Challenges and Healthy Competition

As a health-conscious individual, I want to participate in community challenges with other users, so that I can stay motivated, learn from others, and make my healthy eating journey more engaging and social.

**Detailed Workflow:** Users browse and join various challenges (weekly fruit variety, consistency streaks, seasonal eating). They compete with friends or broader community members, track progress publicly or privately, share achievements, and earn special rewards for participation and success. Challenges include both individual goals and team-based competitions.
