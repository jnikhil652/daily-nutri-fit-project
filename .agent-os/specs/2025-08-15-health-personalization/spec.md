## Overview

Implement comprehensive health personalization features that transform DailyNutriFit from a basic fruit delivery app into an intelligent health-focused platform. This phase introduces health profiling, AI-powered recommendations, subscription plans, and recurring delivery scheduling to provide users with personalized nutritional solutions.

## User Stories

### Health Assessment and Profiling

As a health-conscious user, I want to complete a comprehensive health assessment, so that I can receive personalized fruit recommendations that align with my specific health goals and dietary needs.

**Detailed Workflow:** Users complete an onboarding questionnaire covering health conditions, dietary restrictions, fitness goals, and nutritional preferences. The system processes this data to create a personalized health profile that drives all subsequent recommendations and features.

### AI-Powered Fruit Recommendations

As a busy professional, I want to receive smart fruit recommendations based on my health profile, so that I can trust the app to provide optimal nutrition without research or guesswork.

**Detailed Workflow:** The system analyzes user health profiles, seasonal availability, nutritional requirements, and personal preferences to generate daily, weekly, and monthly fruit recommendations with explanations of nutritional benefits.

### Subscription Plan Management

As a fitness enthusiast, I want to choose from pre-built health-focused subscription plans, so that I can maintain consistent nutrition aligned with my training goals.

**Detailed Workflow:** Users browse curated subscription plans (weight loss, heart health, athletic performance, etc.), preview sample deliveries, and subscribe with flexible scheduling and modification options.
