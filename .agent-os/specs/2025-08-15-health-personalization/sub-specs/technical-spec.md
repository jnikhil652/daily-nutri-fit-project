# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-15-health-personalization/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-15
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Health questionnaire form with conditional logic and validation
- AI recommendation algorithm using nutritional database and user profiles
- Subscription plan management with recurring scheduling
- Real-time health profile updates and recommendation refresh
- Push notification system for health tips and delivery reminders
- Nutritional database integration with comprehensive fruit information
- Flexible delivery scheduling system with pause/resume capabilities

## Approach Options

**Option A: Basic Rule-Based Recommendations**
- Pros: Simple to implement, predictable results, fast development
- Cons: Limited personalization, no learning capability, basic functionality

**Option B: Machine Learning Recommendation Engine**
- Pros: Advanced personalization, learning capabilities, scalable
- Cons: Complex implementation, requires ML expertise, longer development

**Option C: Hybrid Rule-Based with Smart Matching** (Selected)
- Pros: Good personalization, manageable complexity, extensible to ML later
- Cons: Moderate complexity, requires nutritional expertise

**Rationale:** Selected hybrid approach balances personalization quality with development feasibility. Uses rule-based logic for health conditions and preferences while implementing smart matching algorithms for fruit selection. Provides foundation for future ML enhancement.

## External Dependencies

- **@supabase/supabase-js** - Backend API and real-time features
- **react-native-paper** or **@react-native-community/datetimepicker** - Enhanced UI components for forms
- **react-hook-form** - Advanced form handling with validation
- **date-fns** - Date manipulation for scheduling
- **expo-notifications** - Push notifications for health tips

**Justification:** These dependencies enhance user experience for complex health forms, provide robust scheduling capabilities, and enable the notification system required for engagement.

## Health Recommendation Algorithm

### Core Logic Flow
1. Parse user health profile and goals
2. Apply health condition filters (diabetes, heart health, etc.)
3. Calculate nutritional requirements based on goals
4. Match fruits to requirements using nutritional database
5. Apply seasonal availability and preference filters
6. Generate ranked recommendations with explanations

### Nutritional Scoring System
- Base nutritional value scoring (vitamins, minerals, fiber)
- Health condition specific bonuses/penalties
- Goal alignment scoring (weight loss, energy, recovery)
- Seasonal and availability modifiers
- Personal preference weighting

## Subscription Plan Architecture

### Plan Structure
- Plan metadata (name, description, health focus)
- Nutritional targets and requirements
- Default fruit selections and quantities
- Scheduling templates and delivery frequency
- Pricing and wallet integration

### Customization Capabilities
- Modify delivery frequency and timing
- Exclude specific fruits or allergens
- Adjust quantities based on household size
- Pause/resume with flexible date ranges
- Skip individual deliveries
