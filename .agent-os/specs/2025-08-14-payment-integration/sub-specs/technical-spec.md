# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-14-payment-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-14
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Stripe Integration:** Stripe React Native SDK with Payment Intents API
- **Webhook Processing:** Supabase Edge Functions for secure webhook handling
- **PCI Compliance:** No card data stored locally, tokenization via Stripe
- **Authentication:** Stripe Customer creation linked to user profiles
- **Security:** HTTPS only, webhook signature verification, encrypted tokens
- **Error Recovery:** Retry logic for failed payments and network issues
- **Real-time Updates:** Immediate UI updates with webhook confirmation
- **Testing:** Stripe Test Mode integration for development
- **Monitoring:** Payment success/failure tracking and alerts

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Direct Stripe API Integration
- Pros: Full control, custom implementation
- Cons: Complex PCI compliance, security risks, development time

**Option B:** Stripe React Native SDK with Edge Functions** (Selected)
- Pros: PCI compliant, secure tokenization, webhook handling, proven reliability
- Cons: Vendor dependency, requires Edge Function setup

**Option C:** Third-party Payment Aggregator
- Pros: Multiple payment methods, simplified integration
- Cons: Higher fees, less control, additional vendor dependency

**Rationale:** Stripe React Native SDK selected for industry-leading security, PCI compliance out-of-the-box, comprehensive React Native support, and seamless integration with Supabase Edge Functions for webhook processing.

## External Dependencies

- **@stripe/stripe-react-native** - Official Stripe React Native SDK
  - **Justification:** Secure payment processing with PCI compliance and native mobile optimization
- **@supabase/functions-js** - Supabase Edge Functions client
  - **Justification:** Server-side webhook processing and secure payment intent creation
- **react-native-keychain** - Secure token storage (if needed locally)
  - **Justification:** Secure storage of non-sensitive payment tokens

## Implementation Architecture

### Payment Flow Architecture
1. **Payment Method Setup:** User adds card → Stripe tokenizes → Store payment method ID → Link to Stripe customer
2. **Top-up Process:** User initiates → Create payment intent → Process payment → Webhook confirms → Update wallet
3. **Webhook Handling:** Stripe sends webhook → Verify signature → Process event → Update database → Notify client

### Component Structure
- **PaymentProvider:** Context provider for payment state and Stripe instance
- **AddPaymentMethodScreen:** Secure card input using Stripe components
- **PaymentMethodList:** Display and manage saved payment methods
- **TopUpScreen:** Amount selection and payment method choice
- **PaymentProcessor:** Handle payment intents and confirmations
- **WebhookHandler:** Process Stripe webhooks via Edge Functions

### Edge Functions Structure
```typescript
// create-payment-intent.ts
export default async function createPaymentIntent(amount: number, customerId: string)

// process-webhook.ts  
export default async function processWebhook(stripeEvent: Stripe.Event)

// create-customer.ts
export default async function createStripeCustomer(userId: string, email: string)
```

### Security Measures
- No card data stored in app or database
- Webhook signature verification
- Stripe customer isolation per user
- Payment method tokenization
- HTTPS enforcement
- Rate limiting on payment attempts

### Error Handling Categories
- Network connectivity failures
- Card declined scenarios
- Insufficient funds
- Authentication failures  
- Webhook processing errors
- Payment intent confirmation failures
