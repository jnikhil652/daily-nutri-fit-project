# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Payment Integration System
> Created: 2025-08-14
> Status: Planning
> Priority: P1 (High) - Required for wallet top-up, critical for MVP

## Overview

Implement comprehensive Razorpay payment integration that handles secure card processing, payment method storage, webhook management, and seamless integration with the wallet system. This system will enable users to add funds to their wallets and process payments with enterprise-grade security and compliance.

## User Stories

### Add Payment Method

As a user, I want to securely add my credit or debit card information, so that I can easily top up my wallet and make payments without re-entering card details each time.

**Workflow:** User navigates to payment settings, taps "Add Payment Method", enters card information using Razorpay's secure card input, verifies card with small authorization charge, saves card with encrypted storage, and sets as default payment method if desired.

### Process Wallet Top-Up

As a user, I want to add money to my wallet using my saved payment method, so that I can have funds available for quick fruit orders.

**Workflow:** User selects top-up amount, chooses saved payment method or enters new card, reviews transaction details, confirms payment, sees real-time processing status, and receives confirmation with updated wallet balance.

### Handle Payment Failures

As a user, I want to receive clear information when my payment fails and guidance on how to resolve the issue, so that I can successfully complete my transaction.

**Workflow:** User attempts payment, system detects failure (declined card, insufficient funds, etc.), displays specific error message with suggested actions, allows user to try different payment method, and provides customer support contact if needed.

## Spec Scope

1. **Razorpay SDK Integration** - Secure payment processing with Razorpay React Native SDK
2. **Payment Method Storage** - Save and manage user payment methods securely
3. **Webhook Handling** - Process Razorpay webhooks for payment confirmations and failures
4. **PCI Compliance** - Ensure all payment data handling meets PCI DSS standards
5. **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error handling for all payment scenarios

## Out of Scope

- Alternative payment providers (Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal) in Phase 1
- Recurring subscription payments (Phase 2 feature)
- International payment methods and currencies
- Split payments across multiple payment methods
- Payment analytics and reporting dashboard
- Refund processing (handled in separate system)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can securely add and manage payment methods using Razorpay
2. Users can top up their wallet balance with real-time payment processing
3. System handles payment failures gracefully with clear user feedback and recovery options
