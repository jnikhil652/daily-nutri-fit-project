## Overview

Implement a digital wallet system that allows users to store prepaid funds for seamless fruit deliveries. The wallet will support top-up functionality, transaction history, balance management, and secure payment processing to create a convenient payment experience for recurring fruit orders.

## User Stories

### Check Wallet Balance

As a user, I want to view my current wallet balance and recent transactions, so that I can track my spending and know when I need to add more funds.

**Workflow:** User opens the app, navigates to wallet section, views current balance prominently displayed, scrolls through recent transaction history with details (date, amount, description, order reference), and can see available balance for future orders.

### Top-Up Wallet Balance

As a user, I want to add funds to my wallet using my credit/debit card, so that I can have money available for quick and easy fruit orders without entering payment details each time.

**Workflow:** User taps "Add Funds" button, selects predefined amount or enters custom amount, chooses payment method (saved card or new card), confirms transaction with secure payment processing, receives confirmation and sees updated balance immediately.

### Use Wallet for Payments

As a user, I want to pay for my fruit orders directly from my wallet balance, so that I can complete purchases quickly without re-entering payment information.

**Workflow:** User adds fruits to cart, proceeds to checkout, selects wallet as payment method, confirms order with sufficient wallet balance, sees balance deducted immediately, and receives order confirmation with remaining wallet balance.
