# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-14-wallet-system/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-14
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Balance Storage:** Decimal precision balance storage in Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Transaction Logging:** Comprehensive transaction history with immutable records
- **Real-time Updates:** Supabase Realtime subscriptions for balance changes
- **Payment Processing:** Stripe React Native SDK for secure card payments
- **Atomic Operations:** Database transactions to ensure balance consistency
- **Security:** End-to-end encryption for sensitive payment data
- **Audit Trail:** Complete audit log for all wallet operations
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for failed payments and network issues
- **Optimistic UI:** Immediate UI updates with rollback on failure

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Client-side Balance Tracking
- Pros: Fast UI updates, offline capability
- Cons: Security risks, synchronization issues, data consistency problems

**Option B:** Server-side Balance with Real-time Sync** (Selected)
- Pros: Secure, consistent, audit trail, real-time updates across devices
- Cons: Network dependency, slightly slower initial load

**Option C:** Hybrid Approach with Local Caching
- Pros: Fast UI, secure server validation
- Cons: Complex synchronization logic, potential consistency issues

**Rationale:** Server-side balance management selected for security, data integrity, and regulatory compliance. Real-time subscriptions provide fast UI updates while maintaining data consistency and audit trails.

## External Dependencies

- **@stripe/stripe-react-native** - Stripe React Native SDK for payment processing
  - **Justification:** Industry-standard payment processing with strong security and React Native support
- **react-native-keychain** - Secure storage for payment tokens
  - **Justification:** Secure local storage of sensitive payment information
- **@tanstack/react-query** - Server state management for wallet data
  - **Justification:** Efficient caching and synchronization of wallet balance and transactions

## Implementation Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Top-up:** User initiates → Stripe processes → Webhook updates balance → Real-time sync to client
2. **Payment:** Order created → Atomic balance deduction → Transaction recorded → UI updated
3. **Balance Check:** Client subscribes to balance changes → Real-time updates → UI reflects current state

### Component Structure
- **WalletScreen:** Main wallet interface with balance and transaction history
- **TopUpModal:** Modal for adding funds with amount selection and payment
- **TransactionList:** Scrollable list of wallet transactions with search/filter
- **BalanceCard:** Prominent balance display with formatting and currency
- **PaymentMethodSelector:** Choose between saved cards or add new card

### Security Measures
- Server-side balance validation
- Payment token encryption
- Transaction immutability
- Audit logging for compliance
- Rate limiting for top-up requests

### Error Handling
- Network connectivity issues
- Payment processing failures
- Insufficient balance scenarios
- Duplicate transaction prevention
- Balance synchronization recovery
