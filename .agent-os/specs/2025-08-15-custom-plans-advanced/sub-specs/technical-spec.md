# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-15-custom-plans-advanced/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-15
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Interactive drag-and-drop plan builder with real-time nutritional calculations
- Advanced delivery scheduling system with conflict detection and resolution
- Comprehensive nutritional tracking with data visualization and trend analysis
- Smart notification engine with contextual messaging and user behavior analysis
- Flexible delivery modification system with calendar integration
- Seasonal fruit recommendation engine with availability and quality data
- Progress tracking dashboard with goal setting and achievement metrics
- Advanced form validation and error handling for complex plan configurations

## Approach Options

**Option A: Native Mobile UI Components**
- Pros: Best performance, native platform integration, smooth animations
- Cons: Complex implementation, platform-specific code, longer development

**Option B: Web-Based Drag-and-Drop with WebView**
- Pros: Cross-platform consistency, rich web libraries available, easier development
- Cons: Performance concerns, limited native integration, potential UX issues

**Option C: React Native with Gesture Handler and Reanimated** (Selected)
- Pros: Native performance, cross-platform, rich gesture support, smooth animations
- Cons: Learning curve for advanced animations, complex gesture handling

**Rationale:** Selected React Native with advanced gesture libraries because it provides native-level performance while maintaining cross-platform consistency. The rich ecosystem of animation and gesture libraries enables sophisticated drag-and-drop interfaces essential for the plan builder experience.

## External Dependencies

- **react-native-gesture-handler** - Advanced gesture recognition for drag-and-drop
- **react-native-reanimated** - High-performance animations for smooth UI interactions
- **@react-native-community/datetimepicker** - Enhanced date/time selection for scheduling
- **react-native-calendars** - Calendar component for delivery scheduling
- **victory-native** - Data visualization for nutritional tracking charts
- **react-native-super-grid** - Grid layouts for fruit selection interfaces
- **@react-native-async-storage/async-storage** - Local storage for offline plan editing

**Justification:** These dependencies enable sophisticated user interactions required for advanced plan customization while maintaining performance. The combination provides comprehensive tools for complex UI interactions, data visualization, and local data management.
