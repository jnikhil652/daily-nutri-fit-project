## Overview

Implement a comprehensive ordering system that allows users to add fruits to their cart, manage quantities, select delivery preferences, and complete purchases using their wallet balance. This system will provide a seamless shopping experience from fruit selection to order confirmation.

## User Stories

### Add Fruits to Cart

As a user browsing the fruit catalog, I want to add fruits to my shopping cart with specific quantities, so that I can build my desired fruit order before checkout.

**Workflow:** User browses fruit catalog, taps on desired fruit, selects quantity using picker or input field, taps "Add to Cart" button, sees cart icon update with item count, can continue shopping or proceed to cart review.

### Manage Shopping Cart

As a user with items in my cart, I want to review, modify quantities, and remove items from my cart, so that I can finalize my order exactly as I want it before purchasing.

**Workflow:** User taps cart icon, views all added items with images and prices, adjusts quantities using +/- buttons, removes unwanted items with swipe or delete action, sees real-time price updates, and can proceed to checkout or continue shopping.

### Complete Order with Wallet Payment

As a user ready to purchase, I want to select my delivery address, choose delivery time preferences, and pay using my wallet balance, so that I can complete my fruit order efficiently.

**Workflow:** User proceeds from cart to checkout, selects delivery address from saved addresses, chooses delivery date/time preferences, reviews order summary with total cost, confirms payment using wallet balance, receives order confirmation with tracking details.

## Spec Scope

1. **Shopping Cart Management** - Add, remove, and modify fruit quantities in persistent cart
2. **Delivery Address Selection** - Choose from saved addresses or add new delivery location
3. **Delivery Scheduling** - Select preferred delivery date and time windows
4. **Order Summary and Pricing** - Calculate totals including taxes and delivery fees
5. **Wallet Payment Processing** - Complete purchase using wallet balance with order confirmation

## Out of Scope

- Multiple payment method selection (wallet only for MVP)
- Advanced delivery scheduling (recurring deliveries, subscriptions)
- Order modifications after placement
- Gift orders or delivery to multiple addresses
- Promotional codes and discounts
- Order tracking and delivery status updates (Phase 1 should-have feature)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can add fruits to cart, manage quantities, and view cart contents
2. Users can select delivery address and preferred delivery time during checkout
3. Users can complete orders using wallet balance with immediate order confirmation
